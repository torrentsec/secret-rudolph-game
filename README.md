- 🔗 [Original repository](https://github.com/Jiho31/secret-rudolph-game)

> Unofficial fork of **secret-rudolph-game** by Jiho31.
> This fork exists for personal experimentation and “vibe coding”: fast, exploratory development driven by intuition, play, and iteration rather than production discipline.
> - Changes may be unstable, incomplete, or intentionally divergent
> - No intent to merge back into the upstream repository
> - All original credit for concept and base implementation belongs to Jiho31
